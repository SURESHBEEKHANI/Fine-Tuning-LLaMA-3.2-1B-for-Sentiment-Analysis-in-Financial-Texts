# Fine-Tuning Llama 2 with PEFT and QLoRA

This guide details the process for fine-tuning the Llama 2 model using parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques, specifically QLoRA. It covers:

1. **Installing Required Packages**: Install necessary libraries.
2. **Importing Libraries**: Set up the environment with required imports.
3. **Loading and Configuring Data**: Load datasets and configure QLoRA parameters.
4. **Fine-Tuning the Model**: Train the Llama 2 model with QLoRA on the specified dataset.
5. **Monitoring Training**: Use TensorBoard to track training progress.
6. **Generating Text**: Utilize the fine-tuned model for text generation.
7. **Saving and Pushing the Model**: Merge weights and push the final model to Hugging Face Hub.

Refer to each step in the guide for detailed instructions.
